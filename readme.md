2. The plugin integrates seamlessly with Bricks Builder menu

### Step 2: Add Form Webhooks

## üéõÔ∏è Management Features

### Webhook Management
- **Add**: Create new webhook configurations

## üöÄ Auto-Update

The plugin supports automatic updates via GitHub releases. When a new version is available, you'll see an update notification in your WordPress admin.

## üìä How It Works

1. User submits a Bricks form with "Custom" action
2. Plugin extracts form ID from submission
3. Finds matching webhook configuration by Form ID
4. If found, sends form data as JSON to configured webhook URL
5. Displays configured success/error message to the user
6. Logs debug information (if debug mode is enabled)

## üîÑ Migration Support

### From v1.0.4 and Earlier
All previous configurations are automatically migrated to the new table-based interface. No manual action required!

### From Other Webhook Plugins
The plugin uses standard WordPress practices and can coexist with other webhook solutions.

## üîí Security

- All data is properly sanitized and escaped
- WordPress nonces protect admin forms
- Capability checks ensure only administrators can modify settings
- Secure HTTP requests with proper error handling
- Form ID validation prevents common mistakes

## üìù Requirements

- WordPress 5.8 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Bricks Builder theme/plugin
- Valid webhook URL(s)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Form not sending data?
1. Check that Form ID matches exactly (without `bricks-element-` prefix)
2. Ensure form action is set to "Custom" in Bricks
3. Enable debug mode and check debug information
4. Verify webhook URL is accessible

### Multiple forms issues?
1. Ensure each form has unique Form ID
2. Check that all required fields are filled
3. Review configured forms list in debug information
4. Test each webhook URL independently

### Plugin not appearing in Bricks menu?
1. Ensure Bricks Builder is active
2. Plugin will fallback to Settings menu if Bricks is not detected
3. Check user permissions (requires `manage_options` capability)

### Getting errors?
1. Enable debug mode for detailed error information
2. Test webhook URLs independently
3. Ensure proper PHP/WordPress versions
4. Check server error logs
